<HTML><BODY>This book by Thomas Walker Arnold, a former professor of Arabic at the University of London, is not on how to preach Islam, but a study on how the Muslim faith was able to spread itself so quickly through large parts of Africa and Asia. In it, he deviates from the caricature of murderous bands of Arabs spreading the faith by the sword, but shows that a wide range of other factors caused the remarkable success of this new religion. Given the current crisis in many Islamic countries, and the world wide issues with Islamic extremism around the world, this study is still very relevant today.

<p>The text includes a lot of footnotes and accented letters; a few words of Greek, some Latin and a bunch of other languages. The few words in Arabic script may be represented by [**Arabic]; I will take care of these during PP.

</p><p>The double letters with underbar can be encoded as <code>[kh=], [gh=]</code>, etc.

</p><p>The ayin, represented by a high turned comma in transliterated Arabic words and names can be represented by <code>`</code>.
